# IFC.js + Vue 3 + Vite + PWA

Installable, offline-ready IFC viewer based on IFC.js.

Currently based on the [Hello World Tutorial](https://ifcjs.github.io/info/docs/Hello%20world/), will upgrade to `web-ifc-viewer` in the next iteration.

## Next Steps
- modularize with composables;
- replace calls to the `window` object with reactive properties;
- upgrade to `web-ifc-viewer`.
